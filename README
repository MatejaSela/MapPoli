This is a project done at Middlebury College. It involves natural lanugage processing of Twitter data
using Twitter and Google Natural Language Processing API's. It also involes information visualization libraries
and tools. You can open the index file into your favorite browser, or just access the project in the URL below:

The web application is intended to use Twitter sentiment analysis to compare the US congress votes on contraversial bills
and public opinion on topics of abortion (Abortion 2018), immigration (ICE 2018) and Obamacare (2010). To add more
bills or Twitter terms:

Command for googletweet.py 
 python3 googletweet.py keyword maxhours startdate enddate
 e.g. python3 googletweet.py immigration 0.1 0 1

Command for mergejson.py 
 python3 mergejson.py keyword 
 e.g. python3 mergejson.py immigration

For CSV_Reader.py
1) Choose the csv downloaded from govtrack.org
2) Change the open(filepath/bill.csv', encoding="utf-8")
   to the appropriate path of the bill on your machine.
3) Read the legislation, if the legislation is positive towards a topic,
   change if(all_votes[i] == 'Aye') or 'Yes'), if it's negative use "No" or "Nay"
4) Change the open(path/*bill_name*twitter.json') to the appropriate bill name
5) Dump files to the appropriate location using json.dump(combined_data, outfile)
   for the combined data use *bill_name*both and for the congress *bill_name*congress

To add a new visualization in the index.html file:

1) Add a new button to the top header, as currently layed out.
2) Make sure the files are named the same as the items in the
   class "navbar-form navbar-left".
3) If the naming is right, the program should function
